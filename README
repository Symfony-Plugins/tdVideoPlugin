tdVideoPlugin
=============

The `tdVideoPlugin` is a symfony plugin providing easy interface for flash
video player to embed in symfony projects. It is based on my sfVideoPlugin and
is integrated into _TD CMF_.

This plugin is a part of __TD CMF__ and is based on __Doctrine ORM__.

Installation
============

Install the plugin via the subversion repository:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/tdVideoPlugin/trunk plugins/tdVideoPlugin

from the project root directory or by using the command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install tdVideoPlugin

Right after the installation of the plugin, you should update plugin assets:

    $ ./symfony plugin:publish-assets

so that the default JS and CSS files of the plugin are accessible. Everything
is done properly now.

Usage
=====

  * Enable the tdSampleVideo module in your frontend application's
    _config/settings.yml_ enabled_modules section:

        [php]
        enabled_modules: [ ..., tdSampleVideo ]

  * Fixtures are provided with the plugin and 3 flv files in the _data/samples_
    directory (thanks to
    [media_college](http://www.mediacollege.com/adobe/flash/video/tutorial/example-flv.html).
    Run following commands:

        $ ./symfony doctrine:build --all

    and

        $ ./symfony doctrine:data-load

    Now you have to create a directory for video uploads:

        $ mkdir web/uploads/td/video

    and make it writeable:

        $ chmod 777 web/uploads/td/video

    Now you have to copy those 3 sample flv files from _tdVideoPlugin/data/samples_
    to the video upload directory created above. Everything is ready to run the
    following URL in your browser:

        http://your-project/video

  * Enable the td_video admin generator in your backend application's
    _config/settings.yml_ enabled_modules section:

        [php]
        enabled_modules: [ ..., td_video ]

Configuration
=============

You can modify settings of the tdVideoPlugin in the
__config/tdVideoPluginConfiguration.class.php__ file:

  * _td_video_upload_dir_ - upload dir of all video files

  * _td_video_short_text_sign_count_ - character count of a short video
    descrtiption version
